## _todo_list_provider_

This Project is a basic example of a calendar, where you can see the days, record tasks and be notified when it arrives.

In this Flutter project, the knowledge acquired from ADF (Academy of Flutter) regarding the use of Provider, code structure, and state management has been reviewed.
This project is in development, and possibly will not have a definitive version. Whenever I have some leisure time left, I will open this project and test new ideas.

To run this project, please utilize the Firebase and Google services; they will generate the following files (place them in the correct directories as instructed in the official documentation):

- firebase.json
- lib/firebase_options.dart
- android/app/google-services.json

## SECURITY FAILURES

> All keys have already been invalidated
> and the files have been cleaned,
> leaving only a note.
> To proceed, please read lines 9 - 13.

## NOTES

This project has no deadlines; here, some ideas will be submitted as time allows. I am open to new ideas; please open an issue, and we will discuss what the possibilities are.

You may find some unnecessary files in this project, just ignore it may be a note.
